Understood. I’ll conduct a deep technical investigation into designing a cost-effective Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) transmission system at 1550nm over 1 km using modified SFP components and standard supply chains.

This research will begin with a physics-based analysis of FSOC requirements—beam divergence, power needs, optical aperture size, BER vs. bandwidth tradeoffs (100 Mbps vs. 1 Gbps), and how environmental factors like fog, vibration, and night operations influence system performance.

Then I’ll analyze how standard SFP TOSAs work, especially their ball lens and coupling geometry, and how those might be altered or bypassed using beam expanders or other optics to suit FSOC. The goal is to determine if altering or replacing the ball lens and collimation system makes it suitable for free-space use. I will explain the internal geometry, voltages, EMI, and physical integration possibilities.

Next, I’ll go deep into expanded beam connectors—their structure, manufacture, precision requirements, use with or without fibers—and evaluate if they can serve as a transmission-side free-space beam expander for your application.

Finally, I’ll compare all viable designs against the FSOC requirements to assess trade-offs, cost, manufacturability, and how to prototype using dev boards like the Sysmocom SFP experimenter. This section will address alignment, coupling efficiency, testing procedures, and realistic costs from suppliers like Thorlabs, Amphenol, and others.

I’ll get started and report back with a structured technical write-up.


# Free-Space Optical Communication at 1 km (1550 nm) – Link Budget and Constraints

Free-space optical (FSO) links send data with laser beams through air instead of fiber. For a 1 km, 1550 nm FSO link, the **link budget** must overcome geometric spreading and atmospheric losses to deliver enough optical power to the receiver for error-free data. The fundamental attenuation from free-space path loss is high at optical frequencies (an isotropic source at 1550 nm would lose \~198 dB over 1 km) but in practice lasers are highly directional. A well-collimated laser beam spreads only modestly over distance – for example, a typical FSO transmitter might diverge to about a **2 m diameter spot at 1 km**. This divergence corresponds to a beam divergence angle on the order of 1–2 mrad (full angle), which is far narrower than microwave links and greatly aids the link budget by concentrating energy toward the receiver.

**Free-space Link Power Equation:** If a laser with transmit power *P<sub>t</sub>* is expanded into a beam of divergence half-angle *θ* (radians), at distance *L* the beam radius is \~*w* ≈ *L θ*. The power density at that range is *P<sub>t</sub> / \[π(Lθ)<sup>2</sup>]*. A receiver with aperture diameter *D<sub>r</sub>* (area *A<sub>r</sub> = π(D<sub>r</sub>/2)<sup>2</sup>*) will capture power *P<sub>r</sub> ≈ P<sub>t</sub> · (A<sub>r</sub> / π(Lθ)<sup>2</sup>)* for a uniformly filled beam. In more convenient form, if the beam spot at the receiver is much larger than *D<sub>r</sub>*, the **geometric coupling loss** in dB is approximately:

$L_{\text{geo}} \approx -10 \log_{10}\!\Big(\frac{A_r}{A_{\text{beam}}}\Big) = -10 \log_{10}\frac{\pi (D_r/2)^2}{\pi (L θ)^2} = -10 \log_{10}\Big(\frac{D_r}{2Lθ}\Big)^2.$

This highlights that a narrower divergence *θ* (or larger transmit aperture) and a larger receive aperture *D<sub>r</sub>* both improve the power coupling. **Example:** Suppose a 1550 nm FSO uses a transmit telescope of diameter 5 cm achieving *θ ≈ 0.2 mrad*. At *L = 1 km*, the beam diameter will be \~0.4 m. A 10 cm receive lens then captures \~(0.1 m / 0.4 m)<sup>2</sup> = 6.25% of the power, a geometric loss around 12 dB. Such a setup, with a 0 dBm (1 mW) laser, would deliver about –12 dBm to the photodetector *before* considering other losses. Atmospheric attenuation and safety margins must also be included in the link budget.

**Atmospheric Losses:** Clear air has very low attenuation at 1550 nm (typically ≤0.2 dB/km under clear conditions), so for 1 km in clear weather the direct absorption/scattering loss is negligible (\~0.2 dB). However, **adverse weather** can introduce heavy losses. Fog is the most detrimental condition: in dense fog (visibility < 100 m), attenuation can exceed 100–200 dB/km at 1550 nm, which would *entirely* disable a 1 km link. Moderate fog or heavy rain might incur tens of dB loss, requiring fade margins or backup links. **Night vs Day:** Ambient light (sunlight) does not directly cause attenuation but can raise the background noise at the receiver; however, using 1550 nm (infrared) and optical filtering minimizes this. Night conditions are generally favorable (lower turbulence and background light), whereas daytime links may suffer slightly higher scintillation (due to thermal air currents). **Atmospheric turbulence** causes beam wandering and intensity scintillation. The refractive index variations in air (from temperature turbulence) can cause the received signal to fluctuate. For a 1 km horizontal link near ground, moderate turbulence can induce fading on the order of 5–10 dB or more on a 1 Gb/s beam. Advanced FSO systems counter this with adaptive optics or diversity; for example, deformable mirrors can correct wavefront distortions in real-time. In many cases, link margin (extra power budget) and forward error correction (FEC) are used to ride out turbulence-induced fades.

**Eye Safety and Power Limits:** Operating at 1550 nm is advantageous for eye safety – the permissible exposure levels for 1550 nm are higher than for 850 nm, because the eye’s cornea and lens absorb most 1550 nm light before it reaches the retina. This means an FSO transmitter at 1550 nm can use higher power or a larger aperture (thus a less concentrated beam) while still being eye-safe. Commercial FSO systems often stay in Class 1 or Class 1M laser safety limits but can output several tens of milliwatts thanks to 1550 nm operation. For instance, some 1550 nm FSO terminals output +5 dBm to +10 dBm of optical power (3–10 mW) with large beam diameters to remain eye-safe. **Power constraints in SFP modules** will be discussed later, but note that standard SFP lasers (\~0 to +3 dBm) might need boosting for long-range FSOC.

**Bit Rate Considerations (100 Mb/s vs 1 Gb/s):** The target data rate strongly influences the link design due to receiver sensitivity and allowable bit error rate (BER). Generally, a **1 Gb/s optical link** requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio and thus more received optical power than a **100 Mb/s link** for the same BER target. For example, Cisco specifies a typical 1000BASE-LX (1.25 Gb/s, 1310 nm) receiver sensitivity around –20 dBm at BER 1E-12, whereas a 100BASE-FX (1310 nm) Fast Ethernet receiver can often detect signals as low as –28 to –31 dBm. This \~8–10 dB difference arises because the slower 100 Mb/s link uses a narrower bandwidth receiver and can integrate the signal over a longer bit period, making it inherently more sensitive. Thus, a 100 Mb/s FSO link has more power margin (or can go farther) than a 1 Gb/s link given the same optics. In practice, if a 1 Gb/s link budget is tight at 1 km, one might achieve a stable 100 Mb/s link with the same hardware under the same conditions, because the Fast Ethernet optics tolerate lower received power.

**BER and Link Margin:** Fiber optic links typically strive for BER \~1E-12 with negligible packet loss. In FSO, a similar BER is desired, but fluctuations in received power mean designers include a **link margin** (e.g. 10–20 dB above the receiver’s minimum sensitivity) to maintain low BER during fades. If the instantaneous received power drops below the receiver’s threshold, errors will surge – often manifesting as periods of lost packets. Forward error correction (FEC) can mitigate random bit errors (a strong FEC might correct errors up to BER \~1E-3 and output error-free data), effectively extending the link budget by a few dB at the cost of latency. However, deep fades (tens of dB loss) can cause bursts of errors or link outages. Thus, the system design must consider worst-case fading (from fog, misalignment, scintillation) and either provide sufficient margin or incorporate adaptive features (e.g. automatic power control, beam redundancy, or fallback to a lower bitrate) to maintain the BER within acceptable limits.

**Pointing, Alignment, and Platform Stability:** Unlike fiber, FSO requires the transmitter and receiver to line up precisely. A narrow beam with 1 mrad divergence has almost no tolerance for angular misalignment – a 0.5 mrad pointing error at 1 km would shift the beam spot by 0.5 m, potentially missing a 10 cm receiver entirely. Thus, stable mounting or auto-tracking is crucial. *Line-of-sight (LOS) only:* We assume clear LOS with no obstructions. If the transceivers are mounted on buildings or towers, thermal expansion or sway can misalign the link; solutions include beam widening (trading power for tolerance) or active beam steering. On moving platforms like **drones**, vibration and motion present extra challenges. Rapid drone movements can induce pointing jitter; for instance, small high-frequency vibrations might blur the beam, while slow drift can carry it off target. To counter this, one could use a combination of **inertial stabilization and fast steering mirrors**. Modern MEMS micromirror scanners can provide tip-tilt beam adjustments with response times on the order of hundreds of microseconds, effectively stabilizing beams against typical drone vibrations. These MEMS mirrors (1–10 mm apertures) can achieve ±0.5° or more deflection in two axes, which is sufficient to counteract moderate motion, and they do so with very low power (milliwatts) and high speed (some devices resonate at kHz rates, corresponding to sub-millisecond response). Such mirrors or **optical gimbals** would likely be needed if one endpoint is a UAV. In our case, if the FSO transmitter is integrated in an SFP-based module on a drone, careful mechanical damping or an optical stabilizer may be required to maintain alignment to a ground station.

Finally, **FSO vs Fiber BER/link margin:** Fiber links have very stable loss (only gradual changes over time), whereas FSO link quality can fluctuate with the environment. This means an FSO link design often includes an *extra margin* (for example, designing for a BER of 1E-12 at clear weather received power of –28 dBm, even though the sensitivity is –20 dBm, leaving 8 dB margin). Additionally, error-correcting protocols at higher network layers (or FEC at the physical layer) will be important. Typically, the Ethernet media converters or SFPs will handle the line coding and may incorporate some error correction (Gigabit Ethernet uses the 8B/10B or 64B/66B line codes which inherently detect errors but do not correct them). Any **excessive BER on the optical link will translate to data loss** unless managed. Therefore, maintaining an optical *link margin of a few orders of magnitude BER* (e.g. design for 1E-14 raw BER so that under fades it stays below 1E-9) is recommended, possibly supplemented by external FEC units if needed for reliability.

**Summary:** A 1 km, 1550 nm FSO link is feasible with eye-safe laser power (0–10 dBm), provided the beam is collimated to a milliradian-scale divergence and collected by a sufficiently large aperture. The clear-weather channel is almost lossless aside from geometric spread, but real-world links must budget for atmospheric effects and alignment errors. Using lower data rates (100 Mb/s) can relax power requirements due to better receiver sensitivity, but achieving Gigabit throughput is possible with careful design. The following sections discuss how we can leverage standard SFP optical modules and expanded-beam techniques to implement such an FSO link cost-effectively, using existing optical components where possible.

## Adapting SFP Transmit Optics for Free-Space Communication

Commodity SFP transceivers are designed to interface with fiber, but with clever modifications we can repurpose them for free-space optical transmission. The key component in an SFP’s transmitter is the **TOSA (Transmitter Optical Sub-Assembly)**, which contains the laser diode and coupling optics. In a standard SFP, the TOSA’s job is to **launch light into a single-mode fiber** with high efficiency. Typically, a TOSA includes:

* A laser diode (e.g. a 1310 nm Fabry–Pérot or DFB laser for SMF, or a VCSEL for MMF).
* A tiny lens or lens system (often a **ball lens** or a molded aspheric lens) to **collimate and focus** the laser light into the \~9 µm fiber core.
* Possibly a **monitor photodiode** (to measure output power for feedback control) and an optical isolator (to prevent reflections from fiber back into the laser).

In short, the laser in a TOSA produces a diverging output that is **converted by the TOSA’s optics into a small focused spot at the fiber tip**. For example, many TO-can laser packages have a built-in ball lens at the exit window that focuses the beam into the fiber connector ferrule that sits just in front of it. If you open a typical SFP, you often find the TOSA as a metal can or module aligned with the receptacle where the fiber patch cord plugs in. The fiber (via the LC connector) doesn’t actually touch the laser; instead, there’s a tiny air gap and lensing system. The laser diode might have a fast divergence (e.g. 25° x 10° for different axes); the TOSA optics reshape this into a more symmetric beam to inject into the fiber.

**Modifying a TOSA for Free-Space:** To use an SFP for FSOC, we essentially want the SFP to output a **collimated free-space beam** instead of a fiber-coupled beam. There are a couple of approaches:

* **Remove or bypass the fiber coupling lens:** If the TOSA has a ball lens that focuses into the fiber, one idea is to reposition or replace that lens to focus at infinity (collimate the beam) rather than at the fiber distance. A standard ball lens in a TOSA is often placed one focal length away from the laser emitter to focus at a finite distance (the fiber); by moving it slightly further or using a quarter-pitch GRIN lens, we could collimate. Many telecom TOSAs use *GRIN (graded-index) rod lenses* or ball lenses of a few mm in focal length. For instance, a 0.25-pitch GRIN lens (i.e. one-quarter of the sinusoidal refractive index period) produces a collimated output when a point source is at its front focal plane. Off-the-shelf GRIN lenses with pitches \~0.23–0.27 (slightly deviating from 0.25) are often used to achieve a small collimated beam with a desired working distance. So, one could swap the TOSA’s original lens with a GRIN lens of appropriate pitch to get a collimated beam.

* **Use the TOSA’s existing output but add an external collimator:** In this approach, we keep the SFP’s TOSA largely unchanged, but instead of plugging a fiber patch cord into the SFP’s LC receptacle, we insert a custom **fiber stub and lens assembly**. Essentially, we trick the SFP – the laser still thinks it’s launching into fiber, but immediately at the SFP’s port we have a short piece of fiber leading to a micro-collimator. There are miniature **fiber collimator** components available (some even fit inside an LC form-factor). For example, a short single-mode fiber pigtailed to a tiny GRIN lens can serve as a collimator: Thorlabs sells pigtailed GRIN collimators with working distances \~15 mm and beam diameters \~0.5 mm. If such a collimator can be integrated where the LC ferrule would normally sit, the SFP would output a free beam. The **advantage** of this method is that we don’t disturb the internal alignment of the laser – we use the SFP exactly as designed up to the fiber-coupling, and then just don’t run a long fiber. The **disadvantage** is added complexity: we need to fit a fiber + lens inside the tiny SFP nose. Also, any fiber-collimator still introduces an interface (fiber to lens) with associated losses (perhaps 0.5 dB or so).

* **Custom TOSA “can” with a window:** Some TOSA packages are made with just a transparent window or lens, but not specifically for fiber coupling. For instance, a TO-56 can laser with a flat window can emit a free-space beam directly. One could source a DFB laser in a can with a window and then design a micro-optic collimator specifically for it. This essentially means making our own TOSA: laser + lens in a housing that fits the SFP. The SFP MSA dimensions (56.5 × 13.4 × 8.5 mm) constrain the size, but since we are not selling it, we can relax them slightly (e.g. allow a protrusion for a lens). Still, we must fit within the cage to plug into a standard SFP slot if we use a commercial media converter board.

**Ball Lens vs Collimator:** It’s worth examining how a simple ball lens in the standard SFP works. A small spherical lens (ball lens) can focus a diverging laser beam into a fiber. Conversely, if we shift the focus, a ball lens can also collimate the beam. The **focal length** *f* of a ball lens is approximately *f = (n · D)/(4(n–1))* for a sphere of diameter *D* and refractive index *n*. For typical ball lenses (say 1–2 mm diameter, n≈1.8), *f* might be around 0.5–1 mm. In a standard SFP, the fiber core is positioned roughly one focal length away from the lens, so the beam from the laser is focused down into the core. If we instead move the ball lens slightly closer to the laser (so that the laser is at the lens’s focal point), the output will be a collimated beam. This might be achievable by mechanical adjustment if the SFP’s design allows (some TOSAs have a screw or clip that could be modified). However, collimating with a single ball lens may result in a relatively **small collimated beam diameter** – roughly on the order of the lens itself (a few mm or less). The divergence after collimation would then be small but not ultra-parallel; for example, if the laser’s emission has NA \~0.1 (half-angle \~6°) and a 1 mm lens collimates it, the output beam might be a couple millimeters wide and have residual divergence determined by diffraction or lens aberrations.

**Expanded Beam vs Simple Collimation:** For a robust FSO link, we might want a somewhat larger beam to ease pointing and reduce divergence. Using a single small lens from the SFP could give a beam of a few mm diameter with divergence maybe \~5 mrad. While that might work for short distances, a better approach might be to integrate a **beam expander**. A beam expander is essentially a telescope: for example, a two-lens Galilean telescope can take a small input beam and output a wider, less divergent beam. Galilean designs (a negative lens followed by a positive lens) are convenient because they have no internal focus (avoiding any tight beam waist inside that could get damaged by high intensity). They are also compact – crucial for fitting within (or on) an SFP. For instance, one could have the laser output first pass through a small **negative (diverging) lens** to expand the beam, then a positive lens to recollimate it. This would effectively increase the beam diameter by some factor. If we expanded the \~2 mm beam to \~20 mm, we’d cut divergence by 10×. However, a 20 mm optic is far too large for an SFP module. Realistically, we might target, say, a 5–8 mm output beam diameter from a tiny two-lens expander that could be attached to the SFP’s aperture. Commercial **beam expanders** exist in miniature threaded packages (often used for lasers) – for example, a 3× or 5× beam expander with an aperture of a few mm. It may even be possible to screw such a micro-expander onto the SFP if we remove the dust cover and modify the housing.

**Electrical and Thermal Considerations:** Altering the optics doesn’t change the SFP’s electrical interface. We can still use the standard SFP’s laser driver inside the module. One limitation is **available laser power**: SFP modules are limited in input power (typically <1 W power consumption for 1G SFPs). We can’t simply put a 500 mW laser in an SFP without both electrical and thermal issues. However, because 1550 nm is eye-safe at higher powers, one might be tempted to drive a high-power laser to get more FSO distance. A typical SFP laser might output 0 to +3 dBm. Some extended-range SFPs (like 1000BASE-ZX) output up to +5 dBm. If we need more, one approach is to **use an SFP experimenter board** (like the sysmocom SFP experimenter kit mentioned) which can provide a custom power supply and possibly override the soft power limit. The SFP’s EEPROM might limit current for eye safety compliance, but on a dev board we could potentially drive the laser harder (at our own risk). Alternatively, a cooled DFB laser could output \~10 mW (+10 dBm) if given sufficient current – but that might exceed the SFP’s DC-DC converter capabilities. It’s a balancing act: to double the link range, roughly +6 dB more power is needed, which may be unrealistic from a small laser diode without amplification.

**Mechanical Fit:** Because we are focusing on a one-off solution, we can allow the SFP to violate the MSA mechanical envelope slightly. For instance, we could have a small lens tube protruding from where the LC connector would normally plug in. As long as it can still seat into the media converter’s slot and we can connect our optics, this is fine. One could envision designing a custom **SFP nosepiece** that contains the collimating optics. The main SFP PCB and control electronics remain standard, but instead of a fiber receptacle, we attach a little optical assembly. This assembly might include a means to fine-align the lens focus (perhaps a set screw or shim to set the collimation distance). Given the small dimensions, any such adjustments would be delicate – even a 50 µm shift could spoil the focus.

**Keeping the RX in Mind:** In a full bi-directional link, we’d also need a receive path. A stock SFP’s ROSA (Receiver Optical Sub-Assembly) expects fiber-coupled input – it typically has a tiny photodiode and maybe a focusing lens for the fiber. Using that as-is for FSOC would be extremely challenging: you’d have to focus the distant beam onto a 50 µm photodiode active area, which is like hitting a single fiber core. It’s much better to have a separate, larger aperture receiver (with a telescope and photodiode array or a fiber funnel). Therefore, in our design, we might choose to only modify the SFP for transmission, and build a **separate custom receiver unit** with a large lens. (This is common in many FSO systems: the transmit and receive apertures differ in size.) The SFP on the receive side could be used just as an electrical interface (receiving an electrical signal from a custom photodiode amplifier rather than directly from a fiber). However, this is a complex topic on its own and is being considered separately. For now, we ensure our transmitter design does not preclude such a receiver – meaning we transmit a reasonably wide, collimated beam that a larger receiver lens can capture, and we might even include some low-power “pilot” signal or modulation that helps the receiver sense alignment (though for simplicity a continuous beam and external pointing system might be used).

In summary, **converting an SFP for free-space output** is feasible by altering the coupling optics. The simplest implementation is to intercept the optical path at the LC connector and add a fiber-collimator or small lens there to project the beam out. More advanced implementations involve custom TOSA lenses or mini beam expanders to achieve a well-collimated beam. We must remain mindful of power limits of the laser, as standard SFP lasers were not designed to account for free-space loss – but since we only need \~0 dBm at the receiver for 1 Gb/s, a typical SFP’s output might suffice for 1 km with a decent telescope. Next, we examine **expanded beam connector technology** and whether those principles or components can help improve our design (for example, making the beam less sensitive to dust and misalignment).

## Expanded Beam Connector Technology and Free-Space Optics Integration

Expanded beam fiber optic connectors use lenses to **expand and collimate the light** between fiber ends, instead of bringing fibers into physical contact. They were originally developed to create dirt-tolerant, rugged connections for military use, but the same optics can be repurposed for free-space links. In an expanded beam connector, each fiber’s light diverges into a lens which produces a collimated (or slightly focused) beam that traverses an air gap; a mating connector’s lens then refocuses the beam into the other fiber core. The key benefit is that by expanding the beam’s cross-sectional area tens or hundreds of times, **contaminants or misalignments have far less effect** on the loss. A tiny speck of dust that would obscure a 9 µm core (completely blocking a contact connection) might only shadow a few percent of an expanded beam, causing minimal attenuation.

**Physics of Beam Expansion:** Consider a single-mode fiber with mode field diameter *MFD* ≈ 9 µm. If we expand that beam to a diameter of 900 µm (100× expansion), any given dust particle or lateral offset is 100× less significant in relation to the beam size (actually 10,000× less area coverage). The fundamental relationship for a Gaussian beam’s collimated diameter *D* from a fiber is:

$D_{\text{collimated}} \approx \frac{4 \lambda f}{\pi \cdot \text{MFD}},$

for a lens of focal length *f* (this is derived from diffraction of the fiber mode). For example, using a lens with *f* ≈ 4 mm and λ = 1550 nm, with MFD = 10 µm, we get *D* ≈ 0.8 mm (a modest expansion \~90× in area). Larger expansion can be achieved with larger *f* lenses or multi-lens systems. **GRIN lenses** are commonly used in expanded beam connectors due to their compact size and ability to focus without external curvature. A GRIN lens has a radially varying index *n(r) = n\_0 \sqrt{1 - (A r)^2}* that causes light to follow sinusoidal paths through the rod. A quarter-pitch GRIN (length = 0.25 of the full period) will take a point source at its front face and output a collimated beam at the far face. Manufacturers often use slightly off-quarter-pitch lengths (0.23 or 0.29) to deliberately produce a focusing or defocusing slight bias for improved performance. Typical GRIN lenses in expanded beam connectors are \~1.8 mm in diameter with working distances on the order of 10–20 mm. For instance, a pair of 1.8 mm GRIN lenses separated by \~15 mm can couple light with <1 dB loss. This corresponds to an expanded beam diameter of perhaps \~0.3 mm at the midpoint (for multimode 62.5 µm fiber they reported ≤0.5 mm beam at 15 mm) – that is an expansion of \~10× for MMF in that case.

**Misalignment Tolerance:** In an expanded beam system, the coupling efficiency’s sensitivity to lateral misalignment is governed by the overlap of two Gaussian beams. For two beams with waist *w* (radius) misaligned by Δx, the power coupled is approximately *η ≈ exp\[-2(Δx/w)<sup>2</sup>]* (assuming identical beam profiles). Thus, the **effective lateral alignment tolerance increases in direct proportion to the expanded beam width.** If w = 250 µm, a 10 µm misalignment is only 4% of the radius (η ≈ 0.9996, virtually no loss), whereas in a standard SMF connection (w ≈ 5 µm) a 10 µm misalignment loses essentially all power. This is why expanded beam connectors can often be mated with small lateral offsets yet still function. Many expanded beam designs tolerate up to \~50 µm of lateral offset with minimal loss, whereas physical-contact single-mode connectors need alignment within a micron or two. Angular misalignment is also improved – the beam’s numerical aperture is much lower after expansion, so connectors can be a bit “loose” without significant loss.

**Manufacturing and Components:** Expanded beam connectors typically have **two lenses facing each other** at a defined gap. Critical components are the lenses (often precision ball lenses or GRIN rods) and the mechanical housing that holds fibers and lenses in alignment. The housing must maintain sub-micron alignment of each fiber-lens pair and the lens-lens spacing. High-end expanded beam connectors use robust materials: for example, inserts made of **nickel-silver alloys like ARCAP AP-1D** (chosen for its excellent machinability and stability). The lenses are often **fused silica or sapphire** for hardness and thermal stability, and they get anti-reflection (AR) coatings to reduce Fresnel losses. Each mated pair introduces four air-glass interfaces (fiber to lens1, lens1 to air, air to lens2, lens2 to fiber), so AR coatings are crucial. In total, **6 optical surfaces** see the light (including fiber facets) – any reflection can hurt return loss and contribute to insertion loss. Expanded beam MIL connectors typically achieve return loss \~35–40 dB, a bit lower than APC physical contact connectors but sufficient for most uses.

Achieving **low insertion loss (IL)** consistently is a challenge. Single-mode expanded beam connectors often have \~1.5 dB typical IL. The loss comes from slight lens aberrations, diffraction from finite aperture, and mostly from alignment tolerances. In manufacturing, **85% of the variation in IL is due to mechanical precision** – slight decentering of a lens or tilt can cause coupling loss. For example, a lateral lens shift of 10 µm might introduce \~0.5 dB loss in SM expanded beam. Manufacturers mitigate this by active alignment (microscopically adjusting lens positions while monitoring transmitted power) and by rigid fixtures. Some designs use a one-piece molded lens array to ensure fixed alignment between multiple channels (e.g. 12-fiber expanded beam ferrules where micro-holes for fibers and lenses are molded in one block). **Cost** of expanded beam connectors has traditionally been high due to these precision steps and exotic materials (mil-spec expanded beam termini can cost \$100–\$300 each in low volume). However, **new polymer-based expanded beam ferrules** for data centers (by 3M, Molex etc.) aim to reduce cost significantly – potentially even cheaper than physical-contact MPO connectors in volume. For instance, Panduit reported that in automotive contexts, an expanded beam connector’s components can be *just 4–10% the cost* of a physical contact connector, largely because it eliminates labor-intensive polishing. (This refers to injection-molded plastic lens arrays and no need for ultra-precision end-face polishing.)

**Ruggedness:** Expanded beam connectors shine in harsh environments. The **MIL-DTL-83526** standard defines expanded beam connectors for tactical military use. They are typically hermaphroditic (any two connectors mate without male/female distinction) and sealed with o-rings. Specs from products like TE Connectivity’s **PRO BEAM Jr.** or Glenair’s **Eye-Beam** include: operation from about –55 °C up to +85 °C, **durability 3000+ mating cycles**, and environmental resistance like 500 hours of salt spray (corrosion) or more. Some specialized versions even passed **1300+ hours of salt fog** and 500 m depth underwater tests without failure. The expanded beam interface is easy to clean – often a simple blast of air or rinse is enough, whereas a recessed fiber end needs meticulous cleaning. In fact, field kits allow soldiers to clean these connectors with just water if needed (“bucket of mud” tests have shown connectors can be dunked in mud, rinsed, and reconnected with only minor loss). This robustness is why expanded beam has dominated mil/aero applications like tactical networks, oil/gas and mining, where frequent connect/disconnect and dirt are issues.

**Expanded Beam in Data Centers:** As mentioned, companies like Molex (VersaBeam EBO) and 3M are bringing expanded beam to data centers. These use **plastic molded lenses** and sometimes novel approaches like **TIR (Total Internal Reflection) mirrors** to collimate light inside a small form factor. For example, Molex’s VersaBeam expanded beam MPO-like connector can support 16 or even 144 fibers in one connector, with claimed IL stability and low mating force. The design uses a **TIR lens** that reflects and collimates the beam in a very compact unit. These connectors significantly cut down **installation time** – Molex and 3M have claimed up to 85% reduction in time to deploy compared to traditional MPOs, since you don’t spend time cleaning each mating or dealing with individual fiber polishes. While these are not directly for FSOC, they share the principle: free-space beam propagation between lenses. We could potentially re-use some of these components for our FSOC transmitter. For instance, one could take a 12-channel expanded beam ferrule and use just one channel’s optics to get a collimated beam out of a fiber.

**Use in Our FSOC Design:** There are a few ways expanded beam tech could help us:

* **As the interface at the SFP output:** Instead of custom-building the lens assembly, we might use an off-the-shelf expanded beam connector at the SFP’s output. For example, Amphenol Fiber Systems (AFSI) makes an **expanded beam insert (EBOSA)** that converts an LC or ST connection to expanded beam. These are typically bulkhead connectors or patch cables though. We could possibly take a small expanded beam pair and use half of it: connect a short fiber from the SFP into an expanded beam transmitter half, and let the free space beam exit that. Essentially, this is like using a *connector as a collimator*. Indeed, some expanded beam connectors (like QPC’s QBeam or Stratos HMA) have fairly collimated output (a few mrad divergence). Using one would give us a ruggedized, easy-to-clean aperture for the FSO link. The downside is size – many expanded beam connectors are physically bulky (the MIL ones are \~25 mm in diameter). But perhaps a “mini expanded beam” or a single-channel from a multi-fiber array could fit.

* **As design inspiration for alignment:** The expanded beam approach teaches us that having a lens pair with an air gap can be stable and tolerant. We might incorporate a similar lens pair in our design – one on the SFP transmitting side and one on the receiver side – effectively building a **fixed-point FSO link** with expanded beam coupling. However, in our case the “air gap” is 1 km, so the second lens is effectively our receiver telescope.

One caution: expanded beam connectors are typically designed for *short* free-space gaps (the connector halves nearly touch, just not physically contacting). Over 1 km, diffraction will expand the beam much further, so one might consider intermediate relay optics. But fundamentally, the concept scales – it just becomes a very long “connector” with air in between.

**Performance Envelopes of Expanded Beam:** A few highlights important for FSOC:

* **Beam Size and Divergence:** Expanded beam connectors produce beam diameters in the range of 0.1–0.3 mm for single-mode and \~0.2–0.5 mm for multimode at the connector interface. These beams typically have divergence on the order of 1–5° half-angle (since they are only mildly collimated; many are somewhat focused to ensure light gets into the receive lens a few mm away). For an actual FSO over meters to kilometers, we would further collimate to <0.5 mrad ideally. So we may need an additional beam expander.

* **Insertion Loss:** As mentioned, single-mode expanded beam connections can have 1–2 dB loss on average. This is higher than a physical splice (\~0.1 dB) but acceptable in short links. For FSO, 1–2 dB is fine (it’s like 250 m of extra fiber). The benefit is stability against dirt: one study showed only 0.3 dB extra loss when an expanded beam connector lens was deliberately contaminated with dust that completely incapacitated a physical contact connector. We certainly want that resilience for an outdoor FSO terminal.

* **Power Handling:** Expanded beam systems drastically reduce power density. In fiber, 100 mW in a 9 µm core is \~1.6e5 W/cm² intensity, which can cause fiber end-face damage (scorching dust particles). Expand that to 250 µm and it’s \~1.3e3 W/cm² – three orders of magnitude less. Glenair’s “Eye-Beam Power” expanded beam contacts are designed for **20+ W of optical power** (at 1064 nm and 1550 nm) continuous. They report minimal temperature rise even at 20 W, needing no special cooling beyond perhaps a heat-sinking cable jacket. In essence, the expanded beam approach enabled a connector that can handle **100 W lasers** by making the beam so large that the intensity is equivalent to a tiny fraction of a watt in a standard connector. In our case, we won’t have anywhere near that power, but it’s comforting that using expanded beam optics means our few milliwatts pose no risk of optical damage. We just must ensure any lens coatings are of good quality to handle a bit of peak power (if using short pulses for example).

* **Chromatic Effects:** Since expanded beam connectors use lenses, they can have chromatic focal shift and aberrations. Military ones are typically single or narrow band (either for 1310/1550 nm or for 850/1300 nm dual window). They would not transmit broad spectrum or multiple wavelengths with equal efficiency. This is fine for us (1550 nm single wavelength). If we had a DWDM need (multiple close wavelengths), expanded beam might introduce slight differing losses per wavelength unless achromatic optics are used. For FSO, often a single wavelength or a wide spaced WDM is used, so it’s not a major concern. But it’s worth noting that if one tried to multiplex many wavelengths through the same expand/collimate optics, one might see offset foci. In our design, we stick to one channel.

In conclusion, expanded beam connector technology offers **useful building blocks for FSOC:** It provides a means to get a collimated, expanded beam that is robust against dirt and alignment errors. For our prototype, we might not adopt a full MIL connector, but we can apply the same principles. For instance, we could incorporate a **ball lens expanded beam pair**: one lens on the SFP transmitter and one as the “input” to our receiver module. This essentially is building an optical coupled link that is contactless. In fact, Figure 4 in the Laser Focus World article shows an example where an **FSO terminal is connected via fiber to a pluggable transceiver** – that intermediate “FSO box” is effectively doing expanded beam coupling externally (the fiber goes to a collimator in the FSO terminal). Our aim is to miniaturize or internalize that collimation step into the SFP itself.

## Design Trade-offs and System Comparison for a Free-Space Optical SFP Solution

Bringing together the above analyses, we now compare possible implementations and highlight trade-offs, ensuring the lead engineer has the needed information to decide on the path forward.

**1. Free-Space Link Requirements vs SFP Capabilities:** From Section 1, to achieve 1 Gb/s over 1 km, we need roughly –20 dBm or better at the receiver (for BER \~1E-12). If we allocate, say, 10 dB margin for atmosphere and alignment, we’d aim to deliver –10 dBm under clear conditions. Assuming a modest telescope gain (e.g. 12 dB as in our earlier example with a 10 cm receiver lens), the transmitter needs to supply \~+2 dBm (1.6 mW) into the air. Standard SFPs can output around 0 dBm, some up to +5 dBm. So in principle, a high-power SFP (1000BASE-ZX type) could meet the power needs **without modification to the laser**. If using a typical 0 dBm SFP, we might be a couple dB short – but using a slightly larger receiver aperture or a lower data rate (or accepting a bit of FEC) could compensate. In short, *laser power is not the biggest issue*; alignment and optics are.

**2. Approaches Compared:**

* **A. Fiber-Collimator Approach:** Easiest: Use a stock SFP, plug a short single-mode fiber patch cord, and at the other end of that patch cord, use a commercial collimator (e.g. a fiber collimator from Thorlabs). For example, a pigtailed collimator with 15 mm working distance yields a beam \~0.5 mm diameter. We could mount that on the device (just outside the SFP cage). This approach was effectively shown in the Aircision/EFFECT Photonics diagram, where an SFP+ module connects via fiber to an external FSO head. **Pros:** No custom SFP design; we leverage well-tested fiber optics. We can swap collimator designs easily (for wider beam, choose a different lens). **Cons:** It’s not integrated – an extra fiber connection introduces 0.5 dB connector loss, and we now have a fragile fiber jumper in the system. Also, controlling pointing requires mounting the collimator securely and perhaps adding beam steering anyway. But for a prototype, this is a sound baseline. We could test an off-the-shelf 1310 or 1550 nm SFP with a fiber collimator to verify the concept quickly.

* **B. Integrated Collimator SFP (Minimal):** Modify the SFP by inserting a micro lens in place of the LC receptacle, as discussed. This means slightly redesigning the SFP’s mechanical parts. We might take an SFP shell, remove the fiber receptacle, and glue in a GRIN lens at the right position. This yields a standalone “free-space SFP” that one can plug into a media converter and it outputs a collimated beam directly. **Pros:** Self-contained unit, no external fiber pigtail (more robust). Potentially lower loss (one less connector interface). **Cons:** Manufacturing one requires precision alignment: we’d have to ensure the laser is focused correctly on the lens for collimation. We may need iterative adjustments with micrometers and UV-cure epoxy to lock it in place once optimum collimation and pointing are achieved. Also, we sacrifice the ability to fall back to fiber – it’s now a dedicated FS device.

* **C. Expanded Beam Connector Components:** We could attempt to incorporate an expanded beam connector lens as the collimating optic. For instance, use a small ball lens from an expanded beam design (maybe 2–3 mm diameter, AR-coated). Place it at quarter-pitch from the laser (collimating) which might give \~200 µm beam. That’s a bit small for 1 km (diffraction might expand it to >1 m, although that might still be okay if the receiver lens is large). Alternatively, use a two-lens mini-telescope (Galilean) to get a larger beam. Expanded beam connectors themselves often use ball lenses of \~3 mm and result in 250 µm beams, which diverge a lot (several degrees). So to get a truly narrow beam, we need either a larger lens or a combination. This raises mechanical issues: a larger lens (say 10 mm) won’t fit in an SFP. So a compromise is maybe a 3–5 mm lens output, giving a moderately expanded beam. The receiver then must have a matching lens to capture it fully.

* **D. Enhanced Power SFP:** If experiments show the link margin is low (maybe due to atmospheric penalties), one might consider upping the laser power. Using a higher-power laser diode (like a pumped fiber laser or an EDFA booster) is generally not feasible within an SFP form factor or power budget. SFPs typically run off 3.3 V and can draw up to \~300 mA (1 W) without issue; a high-power laser might draw more and also generate more heat. However, a VCSEL array or tapered amplifier could, in theory, boost power. Given the complexity, the better solution for more power is to use an **optical amplifier outside the SFP** (like an EDFA module after the SFP output, before collimation). That defeats some cost purpose but is doable. We mention this only for completeness – our primary design tries to avoid any active optical components beyond the SFP itself.

**3. Alignment and Testing:** Whichever approach we take, testing will be crucial:

* We should measure the **beam profile** exiting the transmitter. A beam profiler or even a scanning detector can map the intensity to ensure it’s roughly Gaussian and collimated (M^2 near 1). If we see divergence, adjust lens positions. For instance, if using the integrated lens approach, we’ll likely do this on an optical bench: drive the SFP’s laser, project the beam to a target 5–10 m away, and adjust until the spot size is minimal divergence (i.e. the beam remains small over that distance). **Cameras** (sensitive NIR cameras or even a card with IR viewing) can help visualize the beam shape.

* **Coupling efficiency:** We can back-to-back test the link in short distance: point the transmitter SFP at a matching receiver (which might initially just be another collimator feeding a fiber to a standard ROSA). By varying alignment, we characterize how forgiving the link is. This will tell us if our expanded beam concept improved alignment tolerance or not. For example, we can introduce small mispointings and see how many dB loss per milliradian, etc.

* **BER under various power levels:** Using a pair of media converters or a loopback, we can generate traffic and measure error rates while attenuating the beam (with a variable optical attenuator or simply by misalignment). This will validate what receiver sensitivity we effectively achieve with the free-space channel. We should test both 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps modes if possible (some SFPs can downshift or we could swap SFPs to a 100BASE-LX if we have one). We expect to see, as theory, the 100 Mb link stays error-free a few dB lower in power than the 1 Gb link.

* **Environmental simulation:** If possible, simulate some turbulence or fog in a controlled way. A simple fog chamber (a plastic box with some mist) could be put in the beam path to see the effect on signal. This might be qualitative, but if heavy fog knocks the link out at, say, 100 m distance, that informs the margin needed.

* **Vibration test:** Mount the SFP transmitter on a small shaker or a drone and measure the received power stability. This will show if additional stabilization is needed. We can perhaps use an accelerometer on the platform to correlate vibration frequencies with any signal fades (likely fast jitter might average out, but resonant pointing oscillations could cause periodic fading). If issues are found, we’d plan to incorporate a MEMS mirror or beam widening.

**4. Cost and Supply Chain Considerations:** We want to leverage existing supply chains to keep costs low:

* Using a **standard SFP module** (perhaps a cheap \~\$20 1000BASE-LX SFP) as the base is far cheaper than designing a laser driver from scratch. We get the benefit of built-in LASER safety shutdown, bias control, and compatibility with Ethernet PHY. The only custom parts will be optical. A small GRIN lens might cost \$50–100 in low quantity, but that’s acceptable. Expanded beam MIL lenses are pricey (sapphire lenses can be >\$100 each), but maybe we can cannibalize a lower-cost source (e.g. a \$10 collimator from a pointer).

* We should ensure the **SFP’s monitoring** features are utilized: Many SFPs provide digital diagnostics (DDM) including the laser bias current and photodiode reading. If our free-space coupling is misaligned or dirty, the monitor photodiode inside the TOSA will see increased back-reflection loss (or at least, the APC circuit will raise bias to maintain power). This can serve as a basic health indicator. In expanded beam connectors, return loss is around 35–40 dB, whereas physical contact APC connectors have 55–60 dB. Our free-space output likely behaves like a Fresnel interface \~–14 dB if uncoated, or –30 dB if AR coated. So the SFP might register a lower return loss than normal. We need to check if the SFP’s APC is okay with that; usually it is, but if not, we might have to disable the laser’s feedback or adjust it.

* The **receiver** in our system (though not in scope here) will likely not be an unmodified SFP ROSA, but rather something like: large lens -> multi-element photodiode or fiber bundle -> maybe connect into an SFP’s ROSA. We mention this because our transmitter should ideally have a clean beam that the receiver design can handle. For example, if the receiver ends up using a multi-mode fiber funnel (to catch light and feed a photodiode), our transmit beam divergence and size should match that acceptance angle. It’s a bit iterative: if receiver has NA \~0.1 and 5 cm lens, then divergence must be <\~5 mrad to couple well. Our design likely can meet that if properly collimated (0.5 mrad or less).

**5. Novel Engineering Considerations:** A few unique ideas to consider:

* **Optical Feedback for Alignment:** The user mentioned possibly measuring intensity across multiple detectors to gauge misalignment. We could integrate a simple pointing feedback by using a small portion of transmit light reflected back from a corner-cube on the receiver (for instance). But in an SFP, we do have a monitor photodiode – not imaging, just total power. It could detect if a significant fraction of transmit light is reflected back (which might occur if the beam hits something). This is more for safety though. A better approach for alignment feedback is to modulate a low-speed pilot tone on the beam and have quad-photodiodes on the receiver to sense angle error (like a tracking system). This is beyond current scope, but we should ensure our transmitter could support a pilot tone – which it can, by simply adding a dither to the laser bias or blinking the Tx off briefly, etc. Since the SFP is AC-coupled for data, a very low frequency modulation might not propagate through the media converter easily, so maybe not trivial. An alternative is an *out-of-band optical beacon* (like an LED or separate low-power laser co-aligned). However, we likely skip this for now. The mechanical alignment during setup (and maybe manual adjustment with a telescope at the other end) might suffice for a fixed link.

* **EMI/EMC:** One might worry that an open-air optical aperture could let out or pick up electromagnetic interference. SFP cages are usually metal-shielded with only the tiny LC opening. If we enlarge that to a lens, we should maintain shielding as much as possible around the electronics. The optical window itself won’t emit RF, but a large opening could let more stray RF in/out. In a lab or benign environment, probably not a big issue; in a military environment, it would be considered (one might use a mesh over the aperture that is transparent to optical but blocks RF – though mesh holes would be tiny relative to beam, not practical). For our design, as long as the rest of the SFP is enclosed, EMI shouldn’t degrade performance. The media converter remains the main source of any emissions (which are minimal at those frequencies relative to typical devices).

**6. Summary of Trade-offs:**

* *Complexity vs Performance:* The fiber-collimator approach (external optics) is simplest but less elegant; the fully integrated approach is cleaner but requires more precision. Expanded beam concepts can improve tolerance to dust which is good for field use; if it’s a lab/demo, a simpler collimator (keep it clean under a cover) might suffice.

* *Cost:* All approaches leverage an existing SFP (\~\$20–\$100). Added optics might add another \~\$100. This is orders of magnitude below dedicated FSO terminals (which can cost \$10k+ for 1 Gbps links). So the plan meets the low-cost goal. Even if we build two prototypes for a full link, it’s a few hundred dollars plus labor, which is very reasonable.

* *Power and Thermal:* We will likely operate the SFP at the edge of its power if needed. We should monitor the SFP case temperature via DDM during operation. If the laser is run at max bias on a hot day, it might overheat or wavelength shift. Possibly select an *industrial temp* SFP (+85 °C capable) for more headroom. If we needed to break MSA power limits, one can do so on the bench by soldering to the laser driver directly – but that voids the nice control. The sysmocom SFP board allows one to feed a custom voltage; one could even wire an TEC (thermoelectric cooler) to chill the laser if needing to over-drive it. But given the analysis, we probably do not need to exceed standard power for 1 km; maybe for 2–3 km we would.

* *Reliability:* Removing physical contacts means no wear on fiber facets – good. Laser lifetime should remain the same (just bias current dependent). If our lens is well secured, nothing should drift. We should consider sealing the optical opening with maybe a transparent cover glass to prevent dust entering the SFP interior. A simple AR-coated glass window could be placed at the aperture. This would mimic expanded beam connectors that often have sealed backshells. If left open, dust could get onto the internal lens or laser, which is harder to clean. So a user-friendly design would have a removable/protective cap or window on the SFP front.

Finally, to tie it together: **The new/modified TOSA approach versus a pure expanded beam or fiber approach** can be seen as a continuum. We could start with a fiber & lens (lowest risk) and gradually integrate more. The expanded beam lessons guide us to prefer collimated beams for robustness. Testing should confirm that a properly collimated SFP can indeed close a 1 Gbps link at 1 km with acceptable BER. If it can, we have essentially created a *personal FSO transceiver* out of commodity parts – a significant achievement given the typical costs of such systems. And because it uses the SFP interface, it’s plug-and-play with standard network equipment (just appearing as a “fiber” link to the switch).

**Conclusion:** Expanded beam technology and standard SFP optics can be cleverly combined to realize a low-cost free-space optical link. By expanding and collimating the beam inside or at the output of an SFP module, we gain the environmental resilience of expanded beam connectors and the convenience of SFP electronics. Our engineering analysis indicates that even a 0 dBm class SFP, when equipped with appropriate optics, should achieve \~1 km at 1 Gbps under clear conditions, with margin for 100 Mbps fallback under harsher conditions. We have identified the critical factors – alignment, beam divergence, power budget, and environmental effects – and outlined how to address each (precision optical alignment, possibly active alignment for vibration, careful link budgeting for fog, etc.). Moving forward, the plan would be to prototype the transmitter with a chosen optical solution (likely starting with a GRIN lens collimator) and measure its performance in a controlled trial. This will validate the concept and inform any tweaks (e.g. if divergence is too high, use a stronger beam expander; if pointing is too sensitive, consider a larger aperture or auto-alignment mechanism). With this deep understanding, the lead engineer can make informed decisions to successfully build an FSOC system leveraging the vast existing supply chain of fiber optic components, avoiding a from-scratch design. The result will be an innovative yet cost-effective solution marrying fiber optics with free-space communications – essentially “fiber optics without the fiber,” achieved by expanded beam techniques and smart repurposing of SFP modules.
