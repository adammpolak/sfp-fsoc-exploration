# Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves & Photons

## Why This Chapter Matters

Every single photon traveling through an SFP transceiver obeys the laws we'll develop here. When you plug in a fiber optic cable and data flows at 10 Gbps, you're witnessing Maxwell's equations in action. The laser diode converts electrical current into coherent electromagnetic waves. These waves propagate through carefully engineered waveguides and fibers. The photodiode on the receiving end converts these waves back into electrical signals. None of this would work without the precise understanding of electromagnetic theory we'll build in this chapter.

By the end, you'll understand:
- Why fiber optics use 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths (spoiler: it's where glass is most transparent)
- How electromagnetic energy actually flows (hint: not through the wires themselves)
- Why single-mode fibers have such specific core diameters (~9 μm)
- What determines the maximum data rate through a fiber
- How quantum mechanics enters the picture through photon shot noise

Let's begin.

## 1.1 Electric and Magnetic Fields: The Fundamental Actors

### What Are Fields?

A field is a mathematical construct that assigns a value to every point in space. Temperature in a room is a scalar field—each location has one number. But electric and magnetic fields are **vector fields**—at each point in space, they have both magnitude and direction.

**Electric Field E**: The force per unit charge that a test charge would experience at that location.
- Units: Volts per meter (V/m) or Newtons per Coulomb (N/C)
- Points in the direction a positive charge would be pushed

**Magnetic Field B**: More subtle—it exerts force only on moving charges, perpendicular to both the charge's velocity and the field itself.
- Units: Tesla (T) or Webers per square meter (Wb/m²)
- Direction given by right-hand rule for force on positive charges

### Why Do We Need Both?

Here's the key insight that took physicists centuries to grasp: **electric and magnetic fields are two aspects of the same phenomenon**. A pure electric field in one reference frame appears as both electric and magnetic fields in a moving reference frame. This relativity of fields hints at the deeper unity Maxwell would discover.

## 1.2 Maxwell's Equations: The Constitution of Electromagnetism

Maxwell's four equations are to electromagnetism what Newton's laws are to mechanics. They completely describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and how they evolve. We'll present both integral and differential forms because each offers different insights.

### Gauss's Law (Electric)

**Integral Form:**

$$\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$

Let's decode every symbol:
- **∮ₛ**: A closed surface integral—imagine summing up contributions over every tiny patch of a closed surface (like a sphere or box)
- **E**: The electric field vector—has magnitude (strength in V/m) and direction (where it points)
- **dA**: An infinitesimal area element—a tiny patch of the surface, with direction pointing outward
- **E · dA**: The dot product—measures how much E points through the surface (parallel = maximum, perpendicular = zero)
- **Qₑₙc**: Total charge enclosed inside the surface
- **ε₀**: Permittivity of free space = 8.854×10⁻¹² F/m—a fundamental constant

**Pseudo-code equivalent:**
```
total_flux = 0
for each tiny_area on closed_surface:
    E_field = electric_field_at(tiny_area.position)
    angle = angle_between(E_field, tiny_area.normal)
    flux_contribution = E_field.magnitude * tiny_area.size * cos(angle)
    total_flux += flux_contribution
    
total_flux == enclosed_charge / epsilon_0
```

**Differential Form:**

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$

Symbol breakdown:
- **∇** (nabla): The gradient operator = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z)—a vector of partial derivatives
- **∇ · E**: The divergence—measures how much E "flows out" from a point
- **ρ**: Charge density [C/m³]—charge per unit volume

**Pseudo-code for divergence:**
```
divergence_at_point = (E_x(x+dx) - E_x(x-dx))/(2*dx) +
                      (E_y(y+dy) - E_y(y-dy))/(2*dy) +
                      (E_z(z+dz) - E_z(z-dz))/(2*dz)
                      
divergence_at_point == charge_density / epsilon_0
```

**What it means**: Electric field lines begin and end on charges. The total electric flux through any closed surface equals the enclosed charge divided by ε₀ (permittivity of free space). Think of electric field lines like water flow—charges are sources (positive) or sinks (negative).

**Why it matters for SFP**: This tells us how charge accumulation in semiconductor junctions creates the built-in electric fields that separate electrons and holes in photodiodes. Without this charge separation, photodetection wouldn't work.

### Gauss's Law (Magnetic)

**Integral Form:**

$$\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0$$

Symbol meanings:
- **∮ₛ**: Again, a closed surface integral
- **B**: The magnetic field vector [Tesla]
- **dA**: Outward-pointing area element
- **= 0**: Always zero! No magnetic charges exist

**Pseudo-code:**
```
total_magnetic_flux = 0
for each tiny_area on closed_surface:
    B_field = magnetic_field_at(tiny_area.position)
    angle = angle_between(B_field, tiny_area.normal)
    flux_contribution = B_field.magnitude * tiny_area.size * cos(angle)
    total_magnetic_flux += flux_contribution
    
total_magnetic_flux == 0  // ALWAYS!
```

**Differential Form:**

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$

**Pseudo-code for divergence:**
```
divergence = (B_x(x+dx) - B_x(x-dx))/(2*dx) +
             (B_y(y+dy) - B_y(y-dy))/(2*dy) +
             (B_z(z+dz) - B_z(z-dz))/(2*dz)
             
divergence == 0  // No magnetic charges to source field lines
```

**What it means**: There are no magnetic monopoles—magnetic field lines always form closed loops. Every field line that enters a region must exit somewhere else.

**Why it matters for SFP**: This constraint shapes how electromagnetic waves propagate in waveguides and fibers, determining allowed mode patterns. It's why we can't have certain field configurations—the math simply forbids them.

### Faraday's Law

**Integral Form:**

$$\oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

Breaking down the symbols:
- **∮c**: A line integral around a closed loop C
- **E**: Electric field vector
- **dl**: Infinitesimal length element along the loop
- **E · dl**: How much E points along the path
- **Φ_B**: Magnetic flux through the loop = ∫∫ B · dA
- **d/dt**: Time derivative—rate of change

**Pseudo-code:**
```
// Calculate circulation of E around loop
circulation = 0
for each tiny_segment on closed_loop:
    E_field = electric_field_at(tiny_segment.position)
    angle = angle_between(E_field, tiny_segment.direction)
    circulation += E_field.magnitude * tiny_segment.length * cos(angle)

// Calculate changing magnetic flux through loop
flux_before = total_B_field_through_loop(time)
flux_after = total_B_field_through_loop(time + dt)
flux_change_rate = (flux_after - flux_before) / dt

circulation == -flux_change_rate
```

**Differential Form:**

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$

The curl (∇×) measures field rotation:
```
curl_x = dE_z/dy - dE_y/dz  // Rotation around x-axis
curl_y = dE_x/dz - dE_z/dx  // Rotation around y-axis  
curl_z = dE_y/dx - dE_x/dy  // Rotation around z-axis
```

**What it means**: A changing magnetic field induces a circulating electric field. This is how transformers work, how generators produce electricity, and crucially, how electromagnetic waves self-propagate.

**Why it matters for SFP**: This coupling between E and B fields is what allows electromagnetic waves to exist. Without Faraday's law, light couldn't propagate through fiber. When the B field in a light wave changes, it creates the E field for the next instant, and vice versa—they bootstrap each other through space!

### Ampère-Maxwell Law

**Integral Form:**

$$\oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{enc} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$

Symbol decoder:
- **∮c B · dl**: Circulation of magnetic field around loop C
- **μ₀**: Permeability of free space = 4π×10⁻⁷ H/m
- **Iₑₙc**: Current passing through the loop
- **Φ_E**: Electric flux through the loop
- **μ₀ε₀ dΦ_E/dt**: Maxwell's addition—"displacement current"

**Pseudo-code:**
```
// Magnetic circulation
B_circulation = 0
for each tiny_segment on closed_loop:
    B_field = magnetic_field_at(tiny_segment.position)
    angle = angle_between(B_field, tiny_segment.direction)
    B_circulation += B_field.magnitude * tiny_segment.length * cos(angle)

// Real current through loop
real_current = sum_of_all_currents_piercing_loop()

// Displacement current (changing E field)
E_flux_before = total_E_field_through_loop(time)
E_flux_after = total_E_field_through_loop(time + dt)
displacement_current = epsilon_0 * (E_flux_after - E_flux_before) / dt

B_circulation == mu_0 * (real_current + displacement_current)
```

**Differential Form:**

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

Where **J** is current density [A/m²].

**What it means**: Circulating magnetic fields are produced by electric currents AND by changing electric fields (Maxwell's crucial addition). Before Maxwell, the equation was incomplete and inconsistent!

**Why it matters for SFP**: The displacement current term (∂E/∂t) is what allows electromagnetic waves to propagate through vacuum and dielectrics where no real current flows. In a fiber, there's no metal carrying current—the changing E field itself creates the B field that creates the next E field, enabling light propagation.

## 1.3 The Wave Equation: Birth of Light

### Deriving the Wave Equation

Maxwell's equations seem like four separate laws, but they contain a hidden unity. By mathematically manipulating them, we can derive the wave equation—and discover that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.

Starting with Maxwell's equations in vacuum (no charges ρ=0 or currents J=0), let's take the curl of Faraday's law:

$$\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times \mathbf{B})$$

**What's a curl of a curl?** Think of it as measuring the "curliness of the curliness"—how the rotation of the field itself rotates. There's a vector identity for this:

$$\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E}$$

Where:
- **∇(∇·E)**: Gradient of divergence—but this is zero in vacuum by Gauss's law!
- **∇²E**: The Laplacian—measures how E differs from its neighborhood average

**The Laplacian in pseudo-code:**
```
def laplacian(field, point):
    # Second derivative in each direction
    d2f_dx2 = (field(x+dx) - 2*field(x) + field(x-dx)) / dx**2
    d2f_dy2 = (field(y+dy) - 2*field(y) + field(y-dy)) / dy**2
    d2f_dz2 = (field(z+dz) - 2*field(z) + field(z-dz)) / dz**2
    return d2f_dx2 + d2f_dy2 + d2f_dz2
```

So we have:

$$-\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times \mathbf{B})$$

Now use Ampère-Maxwell law (with J=0):

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

Substituting:

$$-\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}$$

This gives us the **wave equation**:

$$\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}$$

**What makes this a wave equation?** It has the form:
$$\text{spatial curvature} = \frac{1}{v^2} \times \text{temporal acceleration}$$

Any equation with this structure describes waves propagating at speed v. Here:

$$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} = 299,792,458 \text{ m/s} = c$$

**This was Maxwell's "aha!" moment**: The speed of electromagnetic waves exactly equals the measured speed of light. Conclusion: light IS an electromagnetic wave!

The same derivation for B gives:

$$\nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}$$

**Why this matters for SFP**: Every photon in your fiber obeys this equation. The fiber geometry (through boundary conditions) determines which solutions are allowed—these become the fiber modes. The wave equation also tells us that in materials with higher ε (higher refractive index), waves travel slower—this is why light bends at interfaces and why we can confine it in fiber cores.

## 1.4 Plane Wave Solutions

### What Is a Wave?

Before diving into "plane waves," let's clarify what we mean by a wave in this context. A wave is a disturbance that propagates through space, carrying energy without carrying matter. Ocean waves disturb water height, sound waves disturb air pressure, and electromagnetic waves disturb electric and magnetic fields.

**Key wave properties:**
- **Wavelength (λ)**: Distance between repeating features (peak to peak)
- **Frequency (f)**: How many cycles pass a point per second [Hz]
- **Amplitude**: Maximum disturbance from equilibrium
- **Phase**: Position within the wave cycle
- **Velocity**: How fast the pattern moves

### What Makes It a "Plane" Wave?

A **plane wave** has constant phase across infinite parallel planes perpendicular to the propagation direction. Imagine:
- Ocean waves approaching a straight beach—all points along the shore see the same wave height at the same time
- In 3D, the surfaces of constant phase (wavefronts) are flat planes, not spheres or other shapes

Why study plane waves first?
1. They're the simplest solution to Maxwell's equations
2. Any complex wave can be built from plane waves (Fourier analysis)
3. In fiber optics, after propagating a short distance, light approximates a plane wave locally

### The Simplest Wave

The wave equation admits plane wave solutions:

$$\mathbf{E}(z,t) = E_0 \hat{x} \cos(kz - \omega t + \phi)$$

$$\mathbf{B}(z,t) = \frac{E_0}{c} \hat{y} \cos(kz - \omega t + \phi)$$

Let's decode this completely:
- **E(z,t)**: Electric field as function of position z and time t
- **E₀**: Amplitude—maximum field strength [V/m]
- **x̂**: Unit vector—field points in x-direction
- **cos(...)**: Oscillation—field varies sinusoidally
- **k = 2π/λ**: Wave number—spatial frequency [rad/m]
- **ω = 2πf**: Angular frequency—temporal frequency [rad/s]
- **φ**: Initial phase—where in cycle at z=0, t=0

**Yes, these are the light waves!** When we talk about 1550 nm light in a fiber, we mean electromagnetic waves with:
- λ = 1550 nm (wavelength)
- f = c/λ = 193.4 THz (frequency)
- Period = 1/f = 5.17 femtoseconds (incredibly fast!)

**Pseudo-code for plane wave:**
```
def electric_field(z, t):
    phase = k*z - omega*t + phi
    return E0 * cos(phase) * x_direction

def magnetic_field(z, t):
    phase = k*z - omega*t + phi  // Same phase!
    return (E0/c) * cos(phase) * y_direction
```

### Understanding Phase

**Phase** is the argument of the cosine: (kz - ωt + φ). It tells you where you are in the wave cycle:
- Phase = 0 → at a peak (cos(0) = 1)
- Phase = π → at a trough (cos(π) = -1)
- Phase = π/2 → at zero, heading positive (cos(π/2) = 0)

Two waves are "in phase" when their peaks align, "out of phase" when peak meets trough.

**Why phase matters**: In fiber optics, maintaining phase relationships enables:
- Coherent detection (100G+ systems)
- Interference-based devices (Mach-Zehnder modulators)
- Dispersion effects (different wavelengths accumulate different phases)

### Key Properties of EM Waves

1. **E and B are perpendicular**: In our example, E points in x, B points in y
   - **Why this matters**: Defines polarization—important for polarization-maintaining fibers and polarization-dependent loss

2. **E and B are in phase**: They reach peaks and zeros together
   - **Why this matters**: Energy flow (Poynting vector) pulsates at 2f, but never reverses—light always moves forward

3. **E/B = c**: The ratio of field strengths equals light speed
   - **Why this matters**: Allows us to calculate magnetic effects from electric measurements

4. **Direction of propagation**: Given by **E** × **B** (here, +z direction)
   - **Why this matters**: Determines which way energy flows—crucial for understanding reflections and fiber modes

## 1.5 Energy and the Poynting Vector

### Where Is the Energy?

When we send light through fiber, we're transmitting energy. But where exactly is this energy? Not in the charges (there aren't any in the fiber), but in the fields themselves!

The energy density in electromagnetic fields is:

$$u = \frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{\mu_0}B^2\right)$$

Breaking this down:
- **u**: Energy density [Joules/m³]
- **½ε₀E²**: Energy stored in electric field
- **½B²/μ₀**: Energy stored in magnetic field
- Factor of ½: Like kinetic energy = ½mv²

**Pseudo-code:**
```
def energy_density(E_field, B_field):
    electric_energy = 0.5 * epsilon_0 * E_field.magnitude**2
    magnetic_energy = 0.5 * B_field.magnitude**2 / mu_0
    return electric_energy + magnetic_energy
```

For plane waves, something remarkable happens—the electric and magnetic contributions are always equal:

$$u = \epsilon_0 E^2 = \frac{1}{\mu_0}B^2$$

**Why this matters**: In an SFP, the total energy in the fiber core equals this density times the core volume. During modulation, energy sloshes between E and B fields twice per optical cycle (400,000 times per nanosecond at 1550 nm!).

### How Does Energy Flow?

Energy doesn't just sit there—it flows. The **Poynting vector** describes electromagnetic energy flux:

$$\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$$

Symbol breakdown:
- **S**: Energy flux vector [W/m²]—energy per unit time per unit area
- **E × B**: Cross product—perpendicular to both E and B
- **1/μ₀**: Scaling factor from Maxwell's equations

**Pseudo-code for energy flow:**
```
def poynting_vector(E_field, B_field):
    # Cross product gives direction of energy flow
    direction = cross_product(E_field, B_field)
    magnitude = E_field.magnitude * B_field.magnitude / mu_0
    return magnitude * direction.normalized()

def power_through_surface(surface):
    total_power = 0
    for point on surface:
        S = poynting_vector(E_at_point, B_at_point)
        # Only perpendicular component contributes
        power_density = dot_product(S, surface.normal)
        total_power += power_density * point.area
    return total_power
```

For our plane wave:

$$S = \frac{E_0^2}{2\mu_0 c} \cos^2(kz - \omega t + \phi)$$

The time average gives the **intensity**:

$$I = \langle S \rangle = \frac{E_0^2}{2\mu_0 c} = \frac{1}{2}c\epsilon_0 E_0^2$$

**This is crucial for SFP**: 
- The optical power coupled into a fiber = Intensity × Core area
- A typical single-mode fiber with 80 μm² effective area carrying 1 mW has intensity = 1.25×10⁷ W/m²
- This corresponds to electric field amplitude E₀ ≈ 97 kV/m (huge but in tiny volume!)
- Connector losses occur when Poynting flux doesn't perfectly transfer between fiber cores

## 1.6 Polarization States

### Linear Polarization

Our plane wave example had **E** always pointing in the x-direction—this is **linear polarization**. The general linearly polarized wave can point in any transverse direction:

$$\mathbf{E} = E_0(\cos\theta \hat{x} + \sin\theta \hat{y})\cos(kz - \omega t)$$

### Circular Polarization

If we combine two perpendicular waves with 90° phase difference:

$$\mathbf{E} = E_0[\hat{x}\cos(kz - \omega t) \pm \hat{y}\sin(kz - \omega t)]$$

The electric field vector rotates in a circle as the wave propagates. The ± gives right/left circular polarization.

### Elliptical Polarization

The most general case—unequal amplitudes or arbitrary phase difference between x and y components. The E vector traces an ellipse.

**Why this matters for SFP**: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in fibers occurs because different polarizations travel at slightly different speeds, limiting data rates in long-haul links.

## 1.7 Waves in Materials

### Dielectric Materials

In materials, charges respond to applied fields. For dielectrics (insulators):
- Bound charges create dipoles
- These dipoles produce their own fields
- Net effect: fields are reduced by factor εᵣ (relative permittivity)

Modified wave equation:

$$\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}$$

The wave speed becomes:

$$v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r}} = \frac{c}{n}$$

Where n = √εᵣ is the **refractive index**.

### Dispersion

Real materials have frequency-dependent εᵣ(ω), causing different frequencies to travel at different speeds. This **dispersion** has two key effects:

1. **Material dispersion**: Pulse broadening because a pulse contains many frequencies
2. **Chromatic dispersion**: Different wavelengths separate (prism effect)

In fibers, dispersion is characterized by:

$$D = -\frac{\lambda}{c} \frac{d^2n}{d\lambda^2} \quad \text{[ps/(nm·km)]}$$

**Critical for SFP**: At 1310 nm, standard fiber has zero dispersion. At 1550 nm, D ≈ 17 ps/(nm·km), limiting transmission distance without compensation.

### Absorption

Materials also absorb light. The intensity decays exponentially:

$$I(z) = I_0 e^{-\alpha z}$$

Where α is the absorption coefficient [1/m]. In telecom:
- At 1310 nm: α ≈ 0.35 dB/km
- At 1550 nm: α ≈ 0.20 dB/km

This is why long-haul systems prefer 1550 nm despite higher dispersion.

## 1.8 Boundary Conditions and Reflection

### Matching Fields at Interfaces

When EM waves hit a boundary between materials, Maxwell's equations demand:
1. Tangential **E** continuous
2. Tangential **H** = **B**/μ continuous
3. Normal **D** = ε**E** continuous (if no surface charge)
4. Normal **B** continuous

### Fresnel Equations

These boundary conditions lead to the Fresnel equations for reflection and transmission. For normal incidence:

$$r = \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \quad \text{(amplitude reflection coefficient)}$$

$$t = \frac{2n_1}{n_1 + n_2} \quad \text{(amplitude transmission coefficient)}$$

Power reflection coefficient: R = |r|²
Power transmission coefficient: T = |t|²(n₂/n₁)

**Key for SFP**: At each fiber connector interface (n=1.5 to n=1), about 4% of power reflects back. This is why angled physical contact (APC) connectors are used in high-performance links.

## 1.9 Waveguides and Fiber Modes

### Confinement by Total Internal Reflection

When light travels from high to low refractive index at angle θ > θc = arcsin(n₂/n₁), total internal reflection occurs. This enables fiber optics:
- Core: n₁ ≈ 1.47
- Cladding: n₂ ≈ 1.46
- Critical angle: θc ≈ 83°

### Waveguide Modes

Not all angles work—only specific discrete modes satisfy boundary conditions. For step-index fiber, the number of modes is:

$$V = \frac{2\pi a}{\lambda} \sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}$$

Where a is core radius. 
- V < 2.405: Single mode
- V > 2.405: Multimode

**Design insight**: For single-mode at 1310 nm with typical n values, core diameter ≈ 9 μm. This is why single-mode fibers have such small cores!

### Mode Field Diameter

In single-mode fiber, the fundamental mode has Gaussian-like profile extending beyond the core:

$$E(r) \approx E_0 \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{w^2}\right)$$

The mode field diameter (MFD) 2w ≈ 10.4 μm at 1310 nm is larger than the core, affecting coupling efficiency.

## 1.10 Quantum Leap: From Waves to Photons

### Why Quantum?

Classical EM theory explains propagation perfectly but fails at emission and detection:
- Blackbody radiation ultraviolet catastrophe
- Photoelectric effect threshold
- Discrete atomic spectra

**The Ultraviolet Catastrophe**: Classical physics predicted that a heated object would emit infinite energy at short wavelengths. This obviously doesn't happen—your coffee cup doesn't emit deadly UV radiation! Planck solved this by proposing that energy comes in discrete chunks.

**Photoelectric Effect**: Classical theory said any frequency of light should eject electrons if intense enough. Einstein showed that below a threshold frequency, no electrons emerge regardless of intensity. Light must come in packets with energy E = hf.

### Energy Quantization

Einstein's insight: EM energy comes in discrete packets—**photons**:

$$E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

Where h = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s is Planck's constant.

**Pseudo-code for photon energy:**
```
def photon_energy(wavelength_nm):
    h = 6.626e-34  # J·s
    c = 3e8        # m/s
    wavelength_m = wavelength_nm * 1e-9
    energy_J = h * c / wavelength_m
    energy_eV = energy_J / 1.602e-19
    return energy_eV
```

For telecom wavelengths:
- 850 nm photon: E = 1.46 eV
- 1310 nm photon: E = 0.95 eV
- 1550 nm photon: E = 0.80 eV

**Why this matters**: These energies determine which semiconductors work at which wavelengths. Silicon's bandgap (1.1 eV) makes it transparent at telecom wavelengths—perfect for waveguides but useless for detectors.

### Momentum and Pressure

Photons also carry momentum:

$$p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{h}{\lambda}$$

This creates radiation pressure:

$$P = \frac{I}{c}$$

Where I is intensity [W/m²].

**Real numbers**: A 10 mW laser focused to 10 μm² spot creates pressure ≈ 3.3 Pa. Tiny, but measurable with sensitive equipment. In high-power fiber amplifiers, this pressure can actually move the fiber!

### Photon Statistics

Light from different sources has different statistics:

**Coherent Light (Lasers)**:
- Poisson distribution: P(n) = (μⁿ/n!)e⁻μ
- Mean photon number: μ
- Variance: σ² = μ
- Shot noise: σ = √μ

**Thermal Light (LEDs)**:
- Bose-Einstein distribution
- Variance: σ² = μ + μ²
- Super-Poissonian—extra noise from intensity fluctuations

**Impact on SFP**: Shot noise sets the fundamental limit on receiver sensitivity. For a bit error rate (BER) of 10⁻¹²:
- Ideal detector needs ~10 photons/bit (OOK modulation)
- Real detectors need ~1000 photons/bit due to thermal noise, amplifier noise
- At -20 dBm receiver sensitivity, that's ~10¹³ photons/second!

### Wave-Particle Duality in Practice

In fiber optics, we use both pictures:
- **Wave picture**: Propagation, interference, dispersion
- **Particle picture**: Generation, detection, noise

The transition happens at detection:
```
Laser → [Wave propagation in fiber] → Photodiode
         (Maxwell's equations)         (Quantum detection)
```

## 1.11 Coherence: When Waves Act Like Waves

### Temporal Coherence

Temporal coherence describes how long a wave maintains a fixed phase relationship with itself. Imagine the wave as a sinusoid—how many cycles can you count before the phase randomly jumps?

**Coherence time**:

$$\tau_c = \frac{1}{\Delta f}$$

Where Δf is the spectral width (FWHM).

**Coherence length**:

$$\ell_c = c\tau_c = \frac{c}{\Delta f}$$

**Measuring spectral width**:
```
def coherence_length(center_wavelength_nm, spectral_width_nm):
    c = 3e8  # m/s
    # Convert to frequency domain
    f = c / (center_wavelength_nm * 1e-9)
    delta_f = (c / ((center_wavelength_nm - spectral_width_nm/2) * 1e-9)) - 
              (c / ((center_wavelength_nm + spectral_width_nm/2) * 1e-9))
    return c / abs(delta_f)
```

**Typical values**:
- LED (Δλ ~ 40 nm): ℓc ~ 50 μm
- Fabry-Perot laser (Δλ ~ 4 nm): ℓc ~ 1 mm
- DFB laser (Δλ ~ 0.1 nm): ℓc ~ 10 m
- External cavity laser (Δλ ~ 0.001 nm): ℓc ~ 1 km

**Why it matters**: 
- Coherent detection requires ℓc > bit period × c
- Fiber sensors (gyroscopes) need high coherence
- WDM channel spacing limited by spectral width

### Spatial Coherence

Spatial coherence describes phase correlation across the wavefront. High spatial coherence means:
- All points on wavefront maintain fixed phase relationship
- Beam forms clean focal spot
- Efficient coupling into single-mode fiber

**Van Cittert-Zernike theorem**: For extended source of size D at distance R, coherence area:

$$A_c \approx \left(\frac{\lambda R}{D}\right)^2$$

**Practical impact**: This is why:
- Stars (despite being huge) act as point sources—enormous R/D ratio
- LEDs can't efficiently couple into single-mode fiber—extended source
- Laser diodes need careful design for single spatial mode

### Coherence and Interference

Two waves interfere only within their mutual coherence volume. For visibility V of interference fringes:

$$V = \frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}$$

Visibility degrades when:
- Path difference > ℓc (temporal decoherence)
- Beams from different source points (spatial decoherence)
- Polarizations misaligned

## 1.12 Material Properties at Telecom Wavelengths

### The Fiber Optic Windows

Silica fiber doesn't transmit equally at all wavelengths. Three key windows emerged:

**First Window (850 nm)**:
- Early GaAs lasers operated here
- Loss: ~3 dB/km
- Still used for short-reach multimode

**Second Window (1310 nm)**:
- Zero dispersion wavelength
- Loss: ~0.35 dB/km
- Metro and access networks

**Third Window (1550 nm)**:
- Minimum loss: ~0.20 dB/km
- EDFA amplification available
- Long-haul networks

### Why These Specific Wavelengths?

**Fundamental vibrations**: SiO₂ has absorption peaks from:
- OH⁻ contamination: Strong peak at 1380 nm (water peak)
- Si-O bond vibrations: Increasing absorption >1600 nm
- Rayleigh scattering: ∝ 1/λ⁴, dominates <1000 nm

**The loss equation**:

$$\alpha(\lambda) = \frac{A}{\lambda^4} + B + C(\lambda)$$

Where:
- A/λ⁴: Rayleigh scattering
- B: UV absorption tail
- C(λ): Infrared absorption + impurities

### Dispersion Deep Dive

Total dispersion has multiple components:

**Material Dispersion**: Refractive index varies with wavelength:

$$D_m = -\frac{\lambda}{c}\frac{d^2n}{d\lambda^2}$$

**Waveguide Dispersion**: Mode confinement varies with wavelength:

$$D_w = -\frac{n_2\Delta}{c\lambda}\frac{d^2(Vb)}{dV^2}$$

**Total Chromatic Dispersion**:

$$D = D_m + D_w$$

Standard SMF-28 fiber:
- D = 0 at λ = 1310 nm
- D ≈ 17 ps/(nm·km) at λ = 1550 nm

**Pulse broadening**:

$$\Delta t = D \cdot L \cdot \Delta\lambda$$

For 10 Gb/s, 1 nm source width, 100 km:
- Δt = 17 × 100 × 1 = 1700 ps = 17 bit periods!

### Semiconductor Bandgaps for Telecom

The key materials and their roles:

**Silicon (Si)**:
- Bandgap: 1.12 eV (transparent at λ > 1107 nm)
- Use: Waveguides, modulators, passive components
- Can't emit light (indirect bandgap)

**Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs)**:
- Bandgap: 0.75 eV (In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As)
- Use: Photodetectors for 1310/1550 nm
- High mobility → fast response

**Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (InGaAsP)**:
- Bandgap: Tunable 0.75-1.35 eV
- Use: Lasers, LEDs, optical amplifiers
- Quaternary alloy → wavelength engineering

**The bandgap engineering equation**:

$$E_g(x,y) = 1.35 - 0.72y + 0.12y^2$$

For In₁₋ₓGaₓAsᵧP₁₋ᵧ lattice-matched to InP.

### Nonlinear Effects at Telecom Power Levels

When optical power gets high, new effects emerge:

**Self-Phase Modulation (SPM)**:
- Intensity-dependent refractive index: n = n₀ + n₂I
- Phase shift: Δφ = n₂IL/λ
- Spectral broadening of pulses

**Critical power for 1 rad phase shift**:

$$P_{crit} = \frac{\lambda A_{eff}}{2\pi n_2 L}$$

For SMF-28: P_crit ≈ 4.3 W·km at 1550 nm

**Four-Wave Mixing (FWM)**:
- Three photons create fourth: ω₄ = ω₁ + ω₂ - ω₃
- Crosstalk in WDM systems
- Efficiency ∝ (power)³

**Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS)**:
- Threshold: ~5 mW for narrow linewidth
- Reflects power backward
- Limits power in single-frequency systems

**Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)**:
- Threshold: ~1 W
- Transfers power to longer wavelengths
- Basis for Raman amplifiers

## 1.13 Putting It All Together: The Physics of an SFP Link

Let's trace a single bit—a "1"—through an SFP link, applying all our physics:

### Transmitter Side

**1. Electrical to Optical Conversion**:
```
Electrical "1" (3.3V) → Current (20 mA) → Photons (10¹⁶/second)
```

The laser diode:
- Forward bias lowers barrier
- Electrons and holes injected into active region
- Radiative recombination: E_photon = E_g
- Stimulated emission amplifies coherent light
- Output power: P = ηᵢ(I - Iₜₕ)hf/e

**2. Coupling into Fiber**:
- Laser mode field diameter: ~1 μm × 3 μm (elliptical)
- Lens shapes beam to match fiber mode: ~10 μm (circular)
- Coupling efficiency: η = |∫∫ E_laser · E_fiber dA|²
- Typical coupling loss: 2-3 dB

**3. Reflection Management**:
- Fiber end face: 4% Fresnel reflection
- Anti-reflection coating: <0.1%
- Return loss requirement: >40 dB
- Isolator prevents feedback to laser

### Fiber Propagation

**4. Guided Mode Propagation**:
- Fundamental LP₀₁ mode in single-mode fiber
- Mode field diameter: 10.4 μm at 1550 nm
- Confinement: ~80% power in core
- Effective index: n_eff ≈ 1.468

**5. Loss Accumulation**:
```python
def power_after_fiber(P_in_dBm, length_km, wavelength_nm):
    if wavelength_nm == 1310:
        loss_dB_per_km = 0.35
    elif wavelength_nm == 1550:
        loss_dB_per_km = 0.20
    else:
        loss_dB_per_km = 0.25  # approximate
    
    total_loss_dB = loss_dB_per_km * length_km
    P_out_dBm = P_in_dBm - total_loss_dB
    return P_out_dBm
```

**6. Dispersion Effects**:
- Chromatic dispersion spreads pulse
- 10 Gb/s NRZ: T_bit = 100 ps
- After 100 km at 1550 nm: spread = 170 ps
- Eye closure, intersymbol interference

### Receiver Side

**7. Optical to Electrical Conversion**:
- Photons enter photodiode depletion region
- Absorption creates electron-hole pairs
- Quantum efficiency: η = 0.8
- Photocurrent: I = ηPλe/(hc)

**8. Noise Sources**:
```
SNR = Signal_Power / (Shot_Noise + Thermal_Noise + RIN)

Shot_Noise_Power = 2eI_signal * BW
Thermal_Noise_Power = 4kT * BW / R_load
RIN_Power = RIN * I_signal² * BW
```

**9. Signal Recovery**:
- TIA amplifies photocurrent
- CDR extracts clock, retimes data
- Decision circuit: Is signal > threshold?
- BER = 0.5 * erfc(Q/√2)
- Target: Q > 7 for BER < 10⁻¹²

### Link Budget Example

For 10 km single-mode link at 1550 nm:

```
Transmit Power:        +3 dBm
Connector Loss (2×):   -1 dB
Fiber Loss:           -2 dB (0.2 dB/km × 10 km)
Dispersion Penalty:   -1 dB
Receiver Sensitivity: -15 dBm
---------------------------------
Link Margin:          13 dB (Excellent!)
```
